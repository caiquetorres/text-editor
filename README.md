# Text Editor

A minimal text editor written in C, inspired by VIM.
This project is primarily for learning purposes — exploring how text editors work internally and practicing C programming — so it is not intended for production use.

## Current Work

- Handling tab characters
- Adding more editor commands
- Improving the CLI

Tested on macOS (MacBook).

## Build & Run

```sh
make build
```
